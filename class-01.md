# **HTML**


## **#1 [ How are websites created? ]**

### **What you see:**

_**When**_ you are looking at a
website, it is most likely that
your browser will be receiving
HTML and CSS from the web
server that hosts the site. 

_**Some**_ sites also send JavaScript
or Flash to your browser, and you
will see how to add JavaScript
and Flash in your web pages.

### **How it is created:**

_**Small**_ websites are often written
just using HTML and CSS. Larger, more complex sites may use a database to store data, and programming languages such as PHP, ASP.Net,
Java, or Ruby on the web server.

### **HTML5 & CSS3**
_**Since**_ the web was first created
there have been several versions
of HTML and CSS — each
intended to be an improvement
on the previous version.
Because HTML5 and CSS3
build on previous versions of
these languages, learning these
means you will also be able to
understand the earlier versions
of them.

## **#2 [ Structure ]**

### **How pages use structure?**

_**Think**_ about the stories you
read in a newspaper: for each
story, there will be a headline,
some text, and possibly some
images. The structure is very similar
when a news story is viewed
online (although it may also
feature audio or video).

_**Now**_ think about a very different
type of document — an
insurance form. Insurance forms
often have headings for different
sections, and each section
contains a list of questions with
areas for you to fill in details or
checkboxes to tick. Again, the
structure is very similar online.

### **HTML describes the structure of a page**

_**The**_ HTML code is made up of characters that live inside angled brackets — these are called HTML elements. Elements are usually made up of two tags: an opening tag and a closing tag. (The closing tag has an extra forward slash in it.) Each HTML element tells the browser something about the information that sits between its opening and closing tags.

### **Looking at how other websites are built**
_**When**_ the web was first taking off, one of the most common ways to learn about HTML and discover new tips and techniques was to look at the source code that made up web pages.

_**These**_ days there are many more books and online tutorials that teach HTML, but you can still look at the code that a web server sends to you.

## **#3 [ Extra markup ]**

### **The evolution of HTML**
_**Each**_ new version of HTML was designed to be an improvement on the last (with new elements and attributes added and older code removed). For example HTML4 released in 1997, followed by XHTML 1.0 released in the year 2000. It was decided that HTML 4 should be reformulated to follow the rules of XML and it was renamed XHTML. This meant that authors had to follow some new, more strict rules about writing markup.

## **#4 [ HTML5 Layout ]**
_**As**_ with all HTML5 and CSS3 content, its usage is still subject to change but it is already widely being used by web developers and it is likely that you will want to use them.

_**HTML5**_ introduces a new set of elements that allow you to divide up the parts of a page. The names of these elements indicate the kind of content you will find in them. They are still subject to change, but that has not stopped many web page authors using them already.

_**Many**_ tags can be used in HTML5 for making the page structure and styling it.
