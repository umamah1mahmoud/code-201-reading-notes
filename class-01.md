# **HTML**


## **#1 [ How are websites created? ]**

### **What you see:**

_**When**_ you are looking at a
website, it is most likely that
your browser will be receiving
HTML and CSS from the web
server that hosts the site. 

_**Some**_ sites also send JavaScript
or Flash to your browser, and you
will see how to add JavaScript
and Flash in your web pages.

### **How it is created:**

_**Small**_ websites are often written
just using HTML and CSS. Larger, more complex sites may use a database to store data, and programming languages such as PHP, ASP.Net,
Java, or Ruby on the web server.

### **HTML5 & CSS3**
_**Since**_ the web was first created
there have been several versions
of HTML and CSS — each
intended to be an improvement
on the previous version.
Because HTML5 and CSS3
build on previous versions of
these languages, learning these
means you will also be able to
understand the earlier versions
of them.

## **#2 [ Structure ]**

### **How pages use structure?**

_**Think**_ about the stories you
read in a newspaper: for each
story, there will be a headline,
some text, and possibly some
images. The structure is very similar
when a news story is viewed
online (although it may also
feature audio or video).

_**Now**_ think about a very different
type of document — an
insurance form. Insurance forms
often have headings for different
sections, and each section
contains a list of questions with
areas for you to fill in details or
checkboxes to tick. Again, the
structure is very similar online.

### **HTML describes the structure of a page**

_**The**_ HTML code is made up of characters that live inside angled brackets — these are called HTML elements. Elements are usually made up of two tags: an opening tag and a closing tag. (The closing tag has an extra forward slash in it.) Each HTML element tells the browser something about the information that sits between its opening and closing tags.

### **Looking at how other websites are built**
_**When**_ the web was first taking off, one of the most common ways to learn about HTML and discover new tips and techniques was to look at the source code that made up web pages.

_**These**_ days there are many more books and online tutorials that teach HTML, but you can still look at the code that a web server sends to you.

## **#3 [ Extra markup ]**

### **The evolution of HTML**
_**Each**_ new version of HTML was designed to be an improvement on the last (with new elements and attributes added and older code removed). For example HTML4 released in 1997, followed by XHTML 1.0 released in the year 2000. It was decided that HTML 4 should be reformulated to follow the rules of XML and it was renamed XHTML. This meant that authors had to follow some new, more strict rules about writing markup.

___________________________________________

## **#4 [ HTML5 Layout ]**
_**As**_ with all HTML5 and CSS3 content, its usage is still subject to change but it is already widely being used by web developers and it is likely that you will want to use them.

_**HTML5**_ introduces a new set of elements that allow you to divide up the parts of a page. The names of these elements indicate the kind of content you will find in them. They are still subject to change, but that has not stopped many web page authors using them already.

_**Many**_ tags can be used in HTML5 for making the page structure and styling it.

# **Javascript: The ABC of programing**

![js](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ohpJlve1--/c_imagga_scale,f_auto,fl_progressive,h_420,q_auto,w_1000/https://res.cloudinary.com/drquzbncy/image/upload/v1586605549/javascript_banner_sxve2l.jpg)

## **A: [ What is a script? ]**

_**A**_ script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow step-by-step to achieve a goal.

_**To**_ write a script, you need to first state your goal and then list the tasks that need to be completed in order to achieve it.

_**Start**_ with the big picture of what you want to achieve, and break that down into smaller steps:

1. Define the goal.
2. Design the script.
3. Code each step.

## **B: [ How do computers fit in with the world around them? ]**

_**Computers**_ creat models of the world using data. Programmers make these models using data. That is not as strange or as scary as it sounds because the data is all the computer needs in order to follow the instructions you give it to carry out its tasks.
### **Objects and properties**
_**Objects**_ (things): In computer programming, each physical thing in
the world can be represented as an object.

_**Properties**_ (characteristics): Each property has a name and a value, and each of these name/value pairs tells you something about each individual instance of the object. 

**PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER!**
Computers use data to create models of things in the real world. The events, methods, and properties of an object all relate to each other: Events can trigger methods, and methods can retrieve or update an object's properties. 

## **B: [ How do I write a script for a web page? ]**

### **How HTML, CSS and Javascript work together?**

1. Content layer: . html files This is where the content of the page lives. The HTML gives the page structure and adds semantics.

2. Presentation layer: . css files The CSS enhances the HTML page with rules that state how the HTML content is presented (backgrounds, borders, box dimensions, colors, fonts, etc.).

3. Behavior layer: .js files This is where we can change how the page behaves, adding interactivity. We will aim to keep as much of our JavaScript as possible in separate files.

### **Creating a Javascript:**

_**JavaScript**_ is written in plain text, just like HTML and CSS, so you do not need any new tools to write a script. This example adds a greeting into an HTML page. The greeting changes depending on the time of day. 
 
 ### **Linking to a Javascript file from an HTML page:**

_**When**_ you want to use JavaScript with a web page, you use the HTML < script > element to tell the browser it is coming across a script. Its s re attribute tells people where the JavaScript file is stored.
