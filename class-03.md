# **[ HTML Lists, Boxes, Basic JavaScript Instructions and Decisions and Loops ]**



## **#1 [ HTML Lists ]**
#### (Numbered Lists, Bullet Lists and Definition Lists)
<br/>

1. **Numbered List:** 
Mostly known as "ordered lists". Lists where each item in the list is numbered. For example, the list might be a set of steps, or a legal contract where each point needs to be identified by a section number. 

<hr/>

* **Bullet Lists:** Mostly known as "unordered lists". They are lists where items in the list isn't numbered. For example, the list might be a components of sth, a recipie ingridients for example. Where each points don't need to be identified by a section number. 
<br/>**Follows** an example to distinguish the difference between oredered and unoredered lists written in HTML with the output:

<hr/>

**Definition Lists:** Easily put, they are used to define terminology. Usually it consists of a series of terms and their definitions. Sometimes you might see a list where there are two terms used for the same definition or two different definitions for the same term.
<br/>**Follows** an example written in HTML with the output:

## **#2 [ Boxes in CSS ]**
### (Controlling size of boxes, Box model for borders, margin and padding, Displaying and hiding boxes)
<br/>

1. **Controlling size of boxes:** By default a box is sized just big enough to hold its contents. To set your own dimensions for a box you can use the height and width properties.

2. **Box model for borders, margin and padding:** Every box has three available properties that can be adjusted to control its appearance.
* Border.
* Margin.
* Padding.
<br/>If you specify a width
for a box, then the borders, margin, and padding are added to its width and height.

3. **Displaying and hiding boxes:** The visibility property allows you to hide boxes from users but It leaves a space where the element would have been. This property can take two values:
* hidden: This hides the element.
* visible: This shows the element.

( You may need to note that those are only some of my reading notes. The resources I'll be referring to have much more delightful details and fun tricks for you ).

## **#3 [ Basic JavaScript Instructions ]**

### (Arrays)
<br/>

**What is Array?**

* An array is a special type of variable. It doesn't just store one value; it stores a list of values. 

* You should consider using an array whenever you are working with a list or a set of values that are related to each other. 

* Arrays are especially helpful when you do not know how many items a list will contain.

**Creating an Array:**
<br/>

 Values in an array are accessed as if they are in a numbered list. It is important to know that the numbering of this list starts at zero (not one). 

**Accessing and Changing Values In An Array:**
<br/>

To access a value from an array, after the array name you specify the index number for that value inside square brackets.

You can change the value of an item an array by selecting it and assigning it a new value just as you would any other variable (using the equals sign and the new value for that item).

## **#4 [ Decisions and Loops ]**

<br/>

**Using if...else Statement:** Here you can see that an
if...else statement allows you to provide two sets of code:
1. one set if the condition
evaluates to true.
2. another set if the condition is
false.

As follows:

**Using Switch Statements:**
A switch statement starts with a variable called the switch value. Each case indicates a possible value for this variable and the code that should run if the variable matches that value.

**Loops:** They check a condition. If it returns true, a code block will run. Then the condition will be chicked again, and so on until the condition returns false.

There are three common types of loops. Each repeats a set of statements.:
* For Loops.
* While Loops.
* Do While Loops.

(We already discussed them further in previous notes. Check it out in [Reading Notes of 102](https://umamah1mahmoud.github.io/reading-notes/OperatorsAndLoops) ).
