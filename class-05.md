**Today we're talking about some multimedia elements. So why don't we start by defining what exatly is "multimedia"..**

**Multimedia** is a form of communication that combines different content forms such as text, audio, images, animations, or video into a single presentation, in contrast to traditional mass media, such as printed material or audio recordings. Popular examples of multimedia include video podcasts, audio slideshows, animated shows, and movies. (According to [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multimedia))

**Today** however, we're only discussing images and text as multimedia. And colors as a very important element in all multimedia variations.

## **#1 [Images]**
#### (Adding Images to Pages, The Right Format, Optimizing Images for The Web)
<br/>

There are many reasons why you might
want to add an image to a web page: you
might want to include a logo, photograph,
illustration, diagram, or chart.
That besides all the statics and studies of how large is images influence. Humans are visual creatures.

* You will find more on this topic in the sources.

### **A. How to Add Images to Pages?**
The first step of adding images is choosing them on design and logical bases; images should:
* Be relevant.
* Convey information.
* Convey the right mood.
* Be instantly recognisable.
* Fit the color palette.

Now, to our main questio.. How to?
It's needless to say at this point that we need to add a code so, what is it?


    <img src="https://cdn.wallpapersafari.com/23/52/QVj1oK.jpg" alt="An abstarct design" title="Modern geometric abstractive design. In blue and orange." />

The output of the image in this code should be:

![imageExample](https://cdn.wallpapersafari.com/23/52/QVj1oK.jpg)

<br/>

We added an image, what's next? manipulating it of course! and here comes our dear _**CSS**_ . Either inline, internal or extrnal.
However, there are some simple specifications that can be added to the image code after the source. Like the next example of controlling its dimensions:

    <img src="https://cdn.wallpapersafari.com/23/52/QVj1oK.jpg" alt="An abstarct design" width="600" height="450" />

There are of course much more codes to control using images, either manipulating them or their position in a page. Those I'll leave for you to dig in.

In the beginning we mentioned some design and logic related rules to choose images, now to technical rules:

* Save images in the right format.
* Save images at the right size.
* Use the correct resolution.

### **Tools to edit & save images:**
There are many online and offline tools; absolutely the king on this throne is Adobe Photoshop. And the rest of the royal family of The Adobe's. Well, there are of course many other important tools. Even phone apps at some point. Feel free to search and find more of those tools.

Photographs are best saved as JPEGs; illustrations or logos that use flat colors are better saved as GIFs.

## **#2 [Colors]**
#### (How to specify colors, Color terminology and contrast, Background color)
<br/>

![color](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_2LLXnUdUIc/maxresdefault.jpg)

<br/>

Understanding  Color: Every color on a computer screen is created by mixing amounts of red, green, and blue. To find the color you want, you can use a color picker.

Color picking tools are available in image editing programs like Photoshop and GIMP. You can see the RGB values specified next to the radio buttons that say R, G, B.

Now we will get introduced to two very basic, simple and important terms..
### **1. Colors properties:**

<br/>

### **2. Colors Names in CSS color codes:**

### **CSS3: HSL Colors:** 
CSS3 introduces an entirely new and intuitive
way to specify colors using hue, saturation,
and lightness values.

CSS3: HSL & HSLA; <br/>
The hsl color property has been introduced in CSS3 as an alternative way to specify colors. The value of the property starts with the letters hsl, followed by individual values inside parentheses for hue, saturation, lightness and alpha.<br> Code example:


    body {
    background-color: #C8C8C8;
    background-color: hsl(0,0%,78%);}
    p {
    background-color: #ffffff;
    background-color: hsla(0,100%,100%,0.5);}
* This code is taken derictly from the source.

## **#2 [Text]**
#### (Size and typeface of text, Bold, italics, capitals, underlines and Spacing between lines, words, and letters)
<br/>
