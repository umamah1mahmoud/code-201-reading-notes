## **#1 [ Images ]**
Controlling size and alignment of images using CSS keeps rules that affect the presentation of your page in the CSS and out of the HTML markup. You can also use background images.

### **Basic Images Control:**
You can control images through in-line styling, or using id and class through external CSS file.
- Size of images syntax:

        img {
        width: 100px;
        hight: auto;
        }
- Aligning images syntax:

        img {
        display: block;
        float: right;
        margin-left: 150px;
        margin-right: 200px;
        width: 40%;
        }
- Centering images syntax:

        img {
        display: block;
        margin-left: auto;
        margin-right: auto;
        }

### **Background images:**
You can use a background image behind the box created by any element on a page. Background images can appear just once or be repeated across the background of the box.

- Background image syntax:

        body {
        background-image: url ("images/backgroundImage.jpg");
        }

- controlling background image repetition and position:

        body {
        background-image: url ("images/backgroundImage.jpg");
        background-repeat: no-repeat;
        background-position: center top;
        }

- Shorthand: The background property acts like a shorthand for all of the other background properties you have just seen, and also the background-color property.

        body {
        background: #ffffff url("images/backgroundImage.jpg") 
        no-repeat center top;
        }

### **Image rollovers and sprites:**
You can create image rollover effects by moving the 
background position of an image. To reduce the number of images your browser has to 
load, you can create image sprites.

## **#2 [ Video & Audio APIs ]**

HTML5 comes with elements for embedding rich media in documents - < video> and < audio> - which in turn come with their own APIs for controlling playback.

### **In HTML**
- The whole player is wrapped in a < div> element, so it can all be styled as one unit if needed.
- We have four < button>s â€” play/pause, stop, rewind, and fast forward.

### **In CSS**

Controls:
- We start off with the visibility of the custom controls set to hidden. 
- We give the controls an opacity of 0.5 by default, so that they are less distracting when you are trying to watch the video.

Display and Buttons:
- We use the ::before selector to display the content before each < button> element.
- We use the content property to set the content to be displayed in each case to be equal to the contents of the data-icon attribute. In the case of our play button, data-icon contains a capital "P".

Timer:
- We set the outer .timer < div> to have flex: 5, so it takes up most of the width of the controls bar.
- We also give our inner < div> and < span> the right amount of z-index so that the timer will be displayed on top.

### **Implementing the JavaScript**
- You can improve the efficiency of the code by creating a separate function that runs these lines, then calling that anywhere it is needed, rather than repeating the lines multiple times in the code.

(The steps however are longer than what a short reading can take, don't hesitate to check it out from the sources.)

There are a number of online services for blogging, email 
newsletters, e-commerce and other popular website 
tools (to save you writing them from scratch).

**FTP & third party tools:**<br>
- File Transfer Protocol (FTP) programs allow you to transfer files from your local computer to your web server.
