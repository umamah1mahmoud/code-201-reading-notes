After looking at over a hundred groups for more than a year, Project Aristotle researchers concluded that understanding and influencing group norms were the keys to improving Google’s teams.

Google’s research had identified dozens of behaviors that seemed important, except that sometimes the norms of one effective team contrasted sharply with those of another equally successful group. 

_**A Study**_ In 2008, by a group of psychologists from Carnegie Mellon, M.I.T. and Union College. Recruited 699 people, divided them into small groups and gave each a series of assignments that required different kinds of cooperation.


What interested the researchers, was that teams that did well on one assignment usually did well on all the others.Conversely, teams that failed at one thing seemed to fail at everything. <br>The researchers eventually concluded that what distinguished the ‘‘good’’ teams from the dysfunctional groups was how teammates treated one another. The right norms, in other words, could raise a group’s collective intelligence, whereas the wrong norms could hobble a team, even if, individually, all the members were exceptionally bright.


The researchers noticed two behaviors that all the good teams generally shared:

1. On the good teams, members spoke in roughly the same proportion: On some teams, everyone spoke during each task; on others, leadership shifted among teammates from assignment to assignment. But in each case, by the end of the day, everyone had spoken roughly the same amount.

2.  The good teams all had high ‘‘average social sensitivity’’. They were skilled at intuiting how others felt. 

> ‘We had lots of data, but there was nothing showing that a mix of specific personality types or skills or backgrounds made any difference. The ‘‘who’’ part of the equation didn’t seem to matter.’

There were other behaviors that seemed important as well — like making sure teams had clear goals and creating a culture of dependability. But Google’s data indicated that psychological safety, more than anything else, was critical to making a team work. It is by its very nature, somewhat messy and difficult to implement.

What Project Aristotle has taught people within Google is that no one wants to leave part of their personality and inner life at home! But to be fully present at work, to feel "psychologically safe," we must know that we can be free enough, sometimes, to share the things that scare us without fear of recriminations. <br>We must be able to talk about what is messy or sad, to have hard conversations with colleagues who are driving us crazy. We can’t be focused just on efficiency.
